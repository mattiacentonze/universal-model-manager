/**
 * The impure corner of Layer 2.
 *
 * Everything else under src/verify/ is pure: the gate, the DoD schema, the
 * deterministic checks and the grader protocol all take their side effects as
 * injected deps. This module is where those deps are actually built out of a
 * child_process, a filesystem and an opencode client, so the impurity lives in
 * one named place instead of spread through the plugin factory.
 *
 * Config is read through a getter rather than captured. `cfg` in index.ts is a
 * `let` that is reassigned whenever a command reloads it, so a snapshot taken
 * at construction would leave the grader pinned to the models and enforcement
 * settings that were active when the plugin loaded, and `/preset` would
 * silently stop applying to graded work.
