 * Pure. Entries are skipped — never throw — when:
 *  - the named tier does not exist in the active preset (e.g. a map written
 *    for a preset that defines a tier this one doesn't),
 *  - the agent name collides with a tier name, which would clobber the
 *    plugin's own `@fast`/`@medium`/`@heavy` agents,
 *  - the agent is already registered with a `mode` other than "subagent";
 *    primary agents are the orchestrator, and pinning one to a tier model
 *    would defeat the routing design.
 *
 * Note this can only see agents already present in the opencode config —
 * markdown-defined agents are loaded separately, so their `mode` is not
 * visible here. Listing a primary agent defined in markdown is not caught.
