/**
 * Renewable fenced file lock.
 *
 * The lock file at `${path}.${name}.lock` holds the JSON
 * `{ ownerId, expiresAt }`. Acquiring it uses an exclusive `wx` write so
 * concurrent processes race deterministically — only one wins.
 *
 * A contended, live lock (ownerId present, expiresAt > now) returns
 * `null` immediately; no eviction is attempted and no destructive op
 * touches the file. A contended, stale lock (no owner, expired, or
 * malformed-but-old) opens an eviction protocol that uses an exclusive
 * "evicting" marker directory at `${lockPath}.evicting/owner.json` as a
 * fence: the file holds the in-progress evicter's ownerId. The marker
 * is verified before every destructive seam (re-read, unlink,
 * re-acquire) so a contender whose marker has been hijacked will see
 * ownership has changed and back off without touching the winner's lock.
 *
 * The renewal timer is `setInterval(...).unref()`-ed so it does not
 * keep the Node/Bun runtime alive. Default renewal interval is
 * `max(1000, floor(ttlMs / 3))`.
