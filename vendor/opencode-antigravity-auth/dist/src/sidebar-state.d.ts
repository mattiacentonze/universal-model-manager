/**
 * Sidebar state contract for the OpenTUI sidebar.
 *
 * This module is the read-only seam between the long-running plugin and the
 * Solid/OpenTUI sidebar tree. It deliberately does NOT import account storage,
 * the account manager, OAuth code, or any other privileged host-side module:
 * the TUI is rendered inside the host's terminal and a single stray import
 * could leak credentials or pull a heavy manager into the render path.
 *
 * The plugin writes a redacted snapshot to the file resolved by
 * `getSidebarStateFile()` and the TUI polls it. The contract version is `1`:
 * any future field that the TUI cannot understand must be ignored, and any
 * broken/missing file must collapse to `DEFAULT_SIDEBAR_STATE`.
 *
 * ## Writer surface
 *
 * The plugin-side writers live here too so the read and write halves of the
 * contract evolve together. They are imported by the plugin (auth-loader,
 * quota, fetch-interceptor, event-handler, commands) but never invoked from
 * the TUI's compiled tree — that tree only calls the readers, so the
 * heavyweight core imports below never run inside the host's render path.
 *
 * Every disk mutation follows the same recipe:
 *
 *   1. Serialize through `sidebarWriteChain` so concurrent in-process calls
 *      never interleave merges against the same file.
 *   2. Acquire Task 7's `acquireFencedFileLock` with bounded retry+jitter
 *      (≤2s). A live cross-process holder that does not release in time
 *      surfaces as `SidebarStateLockContentionError`.
 *   3. Re-read and normalize the on-disk state while holding the lock.
 *   4. Merge the new machine or routing payload against the re-read state.
 *   5. `assertOwned()` + `writeJsonAtomic` with mode 0o600, then release.
 *
 * The merge step is deterministic: machine fields adopt only when the new
 * `checkedAt` is ≥ the on-disk one, `routingAuthoritative` is sticky-true,
 * and `activeRouting` is merged independently and pruned to the freshest
 * 100 entries within 24h.
