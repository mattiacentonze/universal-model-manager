/**
 * Lock-held config writer for operator-controlled settings.
 *
 * The /antigravity-quota, /antigravity-account, /antigravity-routing,
 * /antigravity-killswitch, /antigravity-dump, and /antigravity-logging
 * slash commands all mutate a small slice of the persisted
 * `antigravity.json`. This writer:
 *
 *   1. Selects the existing project config (if present) — never the
 *      user one — so a multi-workspace OpenCode install gets per-project
 *      overrides. When no project config exists, the user config is the
 *      fallback.
 *   2. Holds the same fenced file lock Task 7's core uses for the
 *      account pool so two slash commands fired in quick succession
 *      cannot race.
 *   3. Serializes through `writeJsonAtomic` — staged tmp + rename —
 *      so a crash mid-write leaves the previous file intact.
 *   4. Preserves every other top-level field the user may have set
 *      (the operator slice is one slot in the schema, not the whole
 *      file).
 *
 * No raw OAuth refresh tokens ever pass through this writer — the
 * killswitch accounts map is keyed by sha256(refreshToken).slice(0,12)
 * and `OperatorSettings` carries only that hash.
