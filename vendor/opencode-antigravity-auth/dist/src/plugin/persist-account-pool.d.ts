/**
 * Account pool persistence for OAuth flows.
 *
 * Merges a batch of successful OAuth token-exchange results into the
 * persisted pool. All reads + writes happen inside the core
 * `mutateAccountStorage` callback so the mutator sees the freshest
 * state read while the lock is held — without it, a concurrent add
 * would race the read-modify-write and silently disappear.
 *
 * Two upsert keys are honored, in priority order:
 *  1. email — survives refresh-token rotation for the same Google account
 *  2. refresh token — handles the no-email case and out-of-band rotations
 *
 * Destructive (`replaceAll: true`) writes start from an empty v4 inside
 * the same locked callback so a stale merge cannot resurrect a removed
 * account.

 * - `replaceAll: false`  — preserve existing accounts, upsert by email
 *                          then refresh token, bump `lastUsed`
 *
 * Both branches run their mutator INSIDE the locked callback. The
 * `replaceAll` branch seeds the mutator from an empty v4 rather than
 * reading the disk state, but the file lock is still required so the
 * write is atomic against concurrent writers — a deleted-account merge
 * would resurrect a stale account if we wrote without the lock.
