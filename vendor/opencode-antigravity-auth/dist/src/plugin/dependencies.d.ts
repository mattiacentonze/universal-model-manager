/**
 * Composition seam for the opencode Antigravity plugin.
 *
 * `createAntigravityPlugin` is the single host-facing factory. Its surface
 * stayed stable for years (input → PluginResult) so production callers
 * never needed to think about which fetch, transport, or OAuth primitive
 * actually runs under the hood. Tests had to either reach for
 * `mock.module('./agy-transport', …)` or stub `globalThis.fetch` — both
 * leaks that pull on module-graph seams that should be invisible to the
 * factory's public surface.
 *
 * The contract here is intentionally narrow:
 *   - Every dependency below has a default that maps to the current
 *     production function (i.e. no behavior change in production).
 *   - Tests inject deterministic doubles for fetch / transport / OAuth /
 *     filesystem roots / clock so the e2e workspace can run without
 *     hitting the public internet or a real disk root.
 *   - No dependency below is intended to leak into the public exports of
 *     `packages/opencode/index.ts`. That barrel stays at "create the
 *     plugin and give me a PluginResult" — the override shape is a test-
 *     time contract, not a stable API.
 *
 * Anything that already had an inline `dependencies:` injection point on
 * a sub-factory (auth-loader, oauth-methods) is intentionally NOT re-
 * surfaced here. Those seams already work; the goal of THIS file is to
 * catch the seams that did NOT exist yet (fetch, transport, env-resolved
 * filesystem roots, clock).
