/**
 * Privacy-safe data service for the data-first slash-command dialogs.
 *
 * `/antigravity-quota` (this task) and the future `/antigravity-account`
 * dialogs (Tasks 10-11) read from a single shared service so they
 * never touch raw account storage, never see the email PII field, and
 * never run quota network I/O during the dialog's open path — the
 * Refresh action is the only path that performs a live fetch.
 *
 * Why this is a separate module:
 *
 * - `commands.ts` owns the slash-command orchestration; mixing the row
 *   projection + quota refresh logic in there would balloon the surface
 *   for what is fundamentally a small read/refresh service.
 * - The row type (`CommandAccountRow`) is the projection that crosses
 *   the PII firewall into the dialog payload. Defining it here (next
 *   to the code that constructs it) keeps the firewall reviewable.
 * - Tests can pin the read-vs-refresh boundary, the email redaction, and
 *   the refresh-token-keyed persistence in one file rather than chasing
 *   them across the dispatcher + RPC + apply layers.
 *
 * Cache-only opening contract (Task 9 operator requirement):
 *
 *   `listAccounts()` is a pure read of the live AccountManager view
 *   the auth-loader materialized at session start. It performs
 *   ZERO quota manager calls — opening the dialog must be instant even
 *   when the network is unreachable, and quota refresh must remain an
 *   explicit user-driven action so the cached percentages never quietly
 *   rewrite themselves behind the user's back.
 *
 * Refresh-token-keyed persistence (Task 9 plan trap):
 *
 *   `refreshQuota()` runs the shared quota manager across every enabled
 *   account and folds the results back into the live AccountManager +
 *   storage. Concurrent OAuth can renumber the flat `accounts[]` array
 *   between read and write, so we re-read under the lock and key the
 *   update by `refreshToken` (the canonical identity) rather than the
 *   array index. This way a successful OAuth add that lands between
 *   the read and the write cannot cause the refresh to overwrite the
 *   wrong account.
 */
/**
 * Local copies of the few core types the data service touches.
 *
 * The shipped TUI tree cannot depend on the `@cortexkit/antigravity-auth-core`
 * barrel (only subpath imports like `./file-lock` are allowed) — the
 * compiled `command-data.ts` is copied verbatim into `tui-compiled/`,
 * and the type-import would otherwise leak the full core surface into
 * the dialog render path. Declaring the structural shape locally keeps
 * the compiled tree free of the barrel while preserving duck-typed
 * compatibility with the production quota manager.
