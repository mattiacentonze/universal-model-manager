/**
 * Background quota poller.
 *
 * Runs a jittered, `unref()`'d timer that periodically refreshes quota for
 * all accounts and pushes ONE sidebar snapshot per tick. Three-layer
 * cross-process dedup:
 *
 *   1. Freshness gate — the only hard correctness bound for quota snapshots.
 *      Reads `checkedAt` from the on-disk sidebar state; skips quota work when
 *      it is fresher than
 *      `max(intervalMs − 60_000, floor(intervalMs / 2))`. The /2 floor
 *      ensures the gate still fires at the 1-minute minimum interval.
 *
 *   2. Advisory fenced lock — an optimization that lets a single process do
 *      the network work when several wake up simultaneously. Held → skip.
 *
 *   3. Lock throws → FAIL CLOSED (skip this tick, add jitter to next). A
 *      fallback mutex is NOT used here. The correct reasoning is: the
 *      freshness gate (layer 1) already bounds how many refreshes can land;
 *      a secondary "claim marker" file is just a worse re-implementation of
 *      the fenced lock we just failed to acquire — it replicates the same
 *      ownership problem without the protocol guarantees, and any transient
 *      I/O error that made the lock throw will likely affect a claim file
 *      too. The previous poller attempt fell into this trap across three
 *      review rounds; this comment exists so a future reviewer stops
 *      re-litigating it.
